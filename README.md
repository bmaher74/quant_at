# Python Code for Algorithmic Trading

This project is a collection of Python codes that aim to replicate the
Matlab codes for Dr. Ernest Chan's book *Algorithmic Trading*.

The file names for scripts reflect Dr. Chan's Matlab script names, for
example the code for `Ratio.m` is in `Ratio.py`.

All feedback, comments, pull requests are welcome.
